# AI-Based-Career-Guidance-System
AI-Based Career Guidance System is a Python-based, rule-driven application that provides career recommendations based on user interests and academic performance. The project simulates basic AI decision-making using conditional logic and core Python concepts, making it ideal for beginners and freshers.

This project is a basic Python application created to understand how simple programming concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems. Using core Python concepts like if-else conditions, functions, and user input, I built a rule-based Career Guidance System that suggests suitable career options based on the user’s interests and academic performance.
The project helped me learn how logical thinking and basic decision-making can be used to simulate AI-style behavior in a simple way.
